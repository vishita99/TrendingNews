It is because this is Liverpool, so richly decorated, bang in form and 2-1 up from the first leg at Anfield two weeks ago.\n\nBefore Wednesday night\u2019s Craven Cottage return, a remark from the Fulham midfielder Jo\u00e3o Palhinha spoke volumes. \u201cI don\u2019t remember the last time that they lost,\u201d he said. Maybe it is because Liverpool have done so only once in a game of real consequence this season \u2013 that one at Tottenham in September.\n\nThe dreams of the Fulham fanbase are nevertheless vivid. They have made significant strides under Silva; the Championship title in his first season in 2021-22 and then something more impressive: comfortable survival in the Premier League. After Fulham\u2019s previous two promotions from the Championship, they had gone straight back down.\n\nSilva\u2019s team set club records for number of Premier League wins in a season (15) and goals scored in the division (55). They managed to beat Chelsea for the first time in 17 years. Good things are happening; their yo-yo tag no longer feels appropriate. They even had a decent cup run for the first time since 2009-10 when they reached the FA Cup quarter-finals, losing at Manchester United.\n\nThe current run has been better still, sparking excitement and the hope that the club could be primed to enjoy a decisive breakthrough. When supporters close their eyes and watch the second leg against Liverpool play out, it looks exactly like the last time they made it this far in a competition.\n\nIt was 2009-10, the Europa League semi-final against Hamburg and, after a 0-0 first-leg draw in Germany, they trailed to an away goal at Craven Cottage. Needing two to complete the comeback, they got them on one of the old stadium\u2019s most famous nights. It was always going to take something special to top the four-goal swing that they fashioned to beat Juventus at Craven Cottage in the last 16. This was it.\n\nJo\u00e3o Palhinha cannot remember the last time Liverpool lost a match. Photograph: Chris Brunskill/Fantasista/Getty Images\n\nSilva talked a good deal about attitude and belief, and there is a third comeback victory on home turf that is in the minds of Fulham fans \u2013 when they recovered from a 1-0 first-leg defeat at Derby in the 2018 Championship playoff semi-final to win 2-0 in the return. These type of things can happen.\n\n\u201cYou can leave legacies because of results,\u201d Silva said. \u201cWhen you are a type of club like Fulham \u2026 in terms of titles, it\u2019s more difficult to do it. But if you have the chance to fight for it, you are going to. It is not often but there have been good nights at Craven Cottage in the cup or Europa League. It\u2019s something that I\u2019ve listened to over the last two and a half years. Let\u2019s hope we can repeat it tomorrow.\u201d\n\nFulham have never previously reached a League Cup semi-final. They have got to the last four of the FA Cup six times, their lone success coming in a replay against Birmingham in 1975. John Mitchell got the winner in the last minute of extra time and, as such, he is a club legend.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If you pass through a club and you don\u2019t reach good things, I don\u2019t think anybody will remember you in the future.\u201d\n\nSilva has yet to beat Liverpool in four attempts with Fulham but he has gone close, starting with the 2-2 home draw against them in the opening game of last season. This past December, his team were 3-2 up in the league at Anfield with three minutes to play before losing 4-3.\n\nNobody could argue that Liverpool were not value for their 2-1 semi-final lead and yet after Willian had scored first for Fulham, they blew a glorious chance for 2-0 when Bobby De Cordova-Reid failed to square for the unmarked Andreas Pereira. Fulham did not manage the game or the occasion after Curtis Jones had equalised.\n\nIt was interesting to hear Silva bring up Fulham\u2019s shock Carabao Cup exit at Crawley last season \u2013 and go back to it on a number of occasions. He said it was a good time to change things in terms of his players\u2019 mentality, to remind them of the need to give the maximum in every competition and against every opponent. \u201cSince then, we start to look for these competitions with ambition,\u201d he said.

This holds true for West Bengal too. In West Bengal, in the last Assembly elections our effort was to maximise votes in order to defeat BJP & TMC by working with the Congress and other secular allies. TMC has been very aggressive, with Mamata Banerjee even calling us a terrorist organisation and going on saying a lot of other things but I don\u2019t want to enter into that discussion. It is up to them to take whatever position they wish to but this is our stated position. I think the youth of Bengal have responded in a massive way. The brigade parade rally (January 8) was something beyond our expectations too.\n\nSo is it a clear \u2018no\u2019 to the alliance?\n\nIt appears that there can\u2019t be a situation where the TMC and the Left can come together. And we also feel that will only benefit the BJP. The anti-incumbency against the State government is going to help the BJP. Considering the violence unleashed during the local body elections, for defence of democracy in Bengal, the TMC too has to be defeated.\n\nDo you believe that the Opposition is starting the 2024 election campaign with a disadvantage considering the euphoria around the opening of the Ram Temple?\n\nThis was expected. That they want to use it for the elections in a big way was a given. And this is not only our conclusion. The Sankaracharyas have also said questioned the timing, they have asked why was a half-built temple consecrated.\n\nHow do you counter it?\n\nThis is the Hindutva consolidation, which you saw in the last round of Assembly elections. We are very clear on how to counter it and in INDIA parties too there is a general understanding on the issue. It is the people\u2019s day-to-day livelihood issues that will emerge as more important. This (Ram Temple) may have emotive appeal. Yes, people have the right to chose their faith and that we work to protect. But the question is what are the current living conditions. We are living with highest unemployment levels, in the last half a century, uncontrolled price rise and reverse migration. This is an ominous sign, when people return to villages from the cities in order to survive. And at such a time, there has been a consistent assault on MNREGA which is the only lifeline for the rural poor.\n\nIf what you are saying is correct, then how do you explain BJP\u2019s victory in recent Assembly elections?\n\nThe point is \u2014 in the three States \u2014 Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh \u2014 the Congress who was in contest against the BJP, has retained its votes. The question is the extra vote that the BJP got \u2014 that is the Hindutva consolidation. But the BJP did lose in Karnataka, Telangana and Himachal Pradesh. So it is not as if the Indian electorate is going just one way. It is a fact that there is polarisation between Hindutva consolidation and against it.\n\nThe Opposition parties came together on June 23, last year. It has been seven months, INDIA bloc does not have a seat-sharing arrangement in place. Isn\u2019t it already too late?\n\nThe talks are going on. What was agreed between the INDIA parties? The seat division will have to finalised and sealed at the State level. Each State has different political situation. In Kerala for instance, there is a direct confrontation between the CPI(M)-led Left Democratic Front and the Congress-led United Democratic Front. So what seat division are you going to be talk about? And it is that straight confrontation between these two fronts, that the BJP does not manage to get even a single Assembly seat there. In Maharashtra, you have the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi, in Bihar you have the Mahagatbandhan and in Tamil Nadu you have DMK-led secular front. So in each State these talks are already on. And I am sure by end of this month, the situation will be far clearer.\n\nBut there are problematic States such as Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and, of course, the West Bengal?\n\nI have told you about West Bengal and as far as Punjab is concerned, again similar consideration are there. If everybody comes together there, then the anti-incumbency can only help the Opposition (which includes the Akali Dal and BJP) there. So, concretely situation in the State will be assessed. In U.P., I am told, between the major parties discussions are on already.\n\nWill you be joining the Bharat Jodo Yatra?\n\nI have been invited by both Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi. We will see, when and where it is possible for us to join.\n\nThe INDIA bloc parties are yet to hold a joint rally or public meeting, again, isn\u2019t it too late?\n\nI have been saying from the very first meeting o the INDIA bloc, that we need to have a series of public meetings, to have seat adjustments at the state level and on that basis, also announce our vision.

Stokes suggested that Root, who bowls off-breaks, could play a strategic role, especially against left-handed batters like Yashasvi Jaiswal .Root's ability to turn the ball away from the left-hander could potentially pose challenges for the Indian batsmen.This unconventional approach reflects England's adaptability and willingness to explore different options to counter the conditions they face in the Test series against India. The strategic decision will be interesting to watch as the match unfolds.\""It would be a complete and utter 'gut' thing, as most of my decisions like that are. You might even see Rooty taking the new ball, depending on what I feel,\"" said Stokes in the pre-match press conference.\""If (left-hander) Yashasvi Jaiswal opens the batting, you might see Rooty opening the bowling because it's spinning away from the bat,\"" Stokes added.The prospect of Root, an experienced batter, opening the bowling for England in the Test format represents a significant departure from the traditional practice of relying on pacers to start the game, regardless of the conditions. If Root takes up this role, it would indeed alter the dynamics of the game and introduce a novel strategy.Stokes emphasised that the team is not adhering to preconceived ideas about the playing surface. Instead, they are open to adapting their approach based on the evolving situation.This flexible mindset reflects England's willingness to explore unconventional strategies and tailor their game plan according to the specific conditions they encounter in the Test series against India.The decision to potentially use Root as a bowler in a new-ball capacity suggests a creative and adaptive approach by the England team management.\""I don't necessarily think it's bold or brave. It's just me and Baz (head coach Brendon McCullum ) looking at the wicket and picking the XI that we think will give us the best chance. You have always got to think that the ball is going to turn in India, but you don't want to go in with any preconceived ideas.

India know who they want in their XI to play the first of five Tests against England starting on Thursday, but they would prefer to keep the opposition guessing.\n\nBoth players offer compelling reasons to pick them. Kuldeep has \""X-factor\"", India captain Rohit Sharma said on the eve of the game in Hyderabad. While Kuldeep has played only eight Tests since making his debut in March 2017, he has worked on his bowling in the recent past and showcased the very ability that India value in all their bowlers - keeping the stumps in play - even if it has been in limited-overs cricket.\n\n\""Kuldeep gives you a certain X-factor with his bowling,\"" Rohit said. \""You've seen how well he's been bowling of late. Especially the wicket if it has bounce, or if it doesn't have bounce, Kuldeep becomes a factor in those types of conditions as well because he has got superb variations.\n\n\""He is also a much more mature bowler now. He has not played a lot of Test cricket in India because of [R] Ashwin and [Ravindra] Jadeja clearly. But that is what happens. Like with our middle order, all of us got an opportunity really late. But that's the reality of it. You can't hide from it. But Kuldeep being the bowler he is now, from what he was a couple of years back, he is much more improved and he is a very tempting option without a doubt.\""\n\nKuldeep played a Ranji Trophy match in the lead-up to this series; it was his first in over seven years and his first since becoming a Test cricketer. In that game, against Kerala , he bowled 26 overs across two innings and picked up four wickets, including the opposition's highest scorer. The reason he is back in the picture is because Axar didn't really go all that well in India's last home series, against Australia in February-March 2023. Axar bowled only 13 overs each in the first three Tests, but he did end up as one of the team's highest run-getters.\n\nAxar Patel was more impressive with the bat than the ball against Australia in February-March 2023 \u2022 BCCI\n\n\""Axar with his all-round ability, giving us that batting depth, the consistency that he has shown playing in these conditions in Test cricket also is an important factor for us,\"" Rohit said. \""It was a bit of a headache for us to decide who it was going to be. I'm not going to say who it is but it was a challenge for us to make that decision. We know we've got quality around our spin-bowling department, which is a good sign. When you've got quality around your team, when there's a headache to make your playing XI, that's a good sign.\""\n\nAxar's prized weapon is the ball that doesn't turn. Exactly half of his 50 Test wickets are either bowled or lbw, and most of them involve the left-arm spinner beating the right-hander on the inside edge. The reason he kept doing that is because he was also getting the odd ball to turn. Against Australia, he seemed to have lost that a little bit. But now, after recovering from a quadriceps injury that forced him out of the ODI World Cup, Axar looks like he's getting back to his old self. The left-arm spinner comes into these Tests having picked up ten wickets in seven T20Is against Australia and Afghanistan played over the last two months.\n\nWho should be India's third spinner? 824 votes Axar Patel Kuldeep Yadav\n\nThe Hyderabad pitch will turn. Rohit, when asked about it in the pre-match press conference where he was happy to talk at length about various other topics - like the health of Test cricket, the value of blooding new players in, and the strength of his side in home conditions - gave a curt answer: \""Looks good\"".\n\nRahul Dravid , on Tuesday, expected that it would take turn . England are certain to the extent that they're going in with three frontline spinners and only one fast bowler. Kuldeep remains a prospect, especially against an opposition that will not hesitate to attack. Success in ODIs and T20Is has taught him how to cope with batters coming at him.
